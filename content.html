    Ashley’s Story
</h2>

<blockquote>
    After watching our daughter Ashley struggle for years with drug and alcohol addiction along with making poor life choices, we encouraged her to try Grace House of San Antonio.
</blockquote>

<em>After a stint in jail, Ashley began to see God had better plans for her life.</em>

<p>
    She embraced the opportunity to enter Grace House of San Antonio and spent the full 9 months allowing God to show her a new way.  
</p>    

<p>    
    After seeing the results that were brought on by this ministry and the burning desire Ashley has to help others, we felt Longview could use a faith based transition home here.
</p>

<p>
    We are blessed by this community as the owners of McDaniel’s Quality Body Works and are proud to say that a portion of our profits will go to help fund Grace House of Longview.

<h2 class="text-center">MISSION</h2>

<p>
    Our mission with Grace House of Longview is to provide our community with a faith based transition home for young women who have struggling with life after incarceration due to addictions and other poor living choices. Each woman will be interviewed to determine her desire to commit to 9 months of spiritual training to help lead her to a Christ centered and addiction free life.
